# Scene-Graph-Generation

Prediction of action and spatial visual relationships in images between objects in the VRD-Dataset. It works in six phases:
1). Date pre-processing and augmentation using clustering
2). Object detection through which buildinga fully connected graph 
3). Features generation- visual, semantic, spatial 
4). Heatmap generation forevery relationship 
5). Predicate detection using structural ranking loss
